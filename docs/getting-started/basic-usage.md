# Basic Usage

## Binaries

Running as a binary means you don't need to do anything additional for identityvalidation to leverage the environment variables you have already exported. You can test that things are working properly by running:

```bash
identityvalidation TODO
```

## Docker


```bash
docker run \
 TODO
```
