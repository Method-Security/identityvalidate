# Basic Usage

## Binaries

Running as a binary means you don't need to do anything additional for identityvalidate to leverage the environment variables you have already exported. You can test that things are working properly by running:

```bash
identityvalidate <resource>
```

## Docker


```bash
docker run \
 identityvalidate <resource>
```
